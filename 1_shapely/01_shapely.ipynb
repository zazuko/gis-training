A practical example would be a country that is composed of several islands. In such case, all these polygons share the same attributes on the country-level and it might be reasonable to store that country as geometry collection that contains all the polygons. The attribute table would then contain one row of information with country-level attributes, and the geometry related to those attributes would represent several polygon. \n",
